problem: japanese is a really hard subject so my teacher sent a excel spreadsheet of all the vocabulary in the syllabus
solution: i'd rather spend 3 months slowly building a program in between assessments to 
automatically build flashcards than to study normally

Basically: takes a csv file containing your japanese vocabularly and creates ANKI flashcards
input has to be perfectly formatted or else the program will throw a hissy fit

Example: Follow this template exactly (because that's what my japanese teacher gave me)

topic1, , ,                topic2, , , ...      \n
word, translation, kanji,  word, translation, kanji, ... \n
... \n

Output:

(this program does NOT check duplicates, beware)
